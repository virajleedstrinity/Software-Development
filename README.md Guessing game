#Guessing Game
How the my guessing game  works is that the user will input a number it will then check the number the user has inputed and the tell the user if the number they have entered is
to high or too low. The user will then be able to guess 8 more times before they get told actual number. if the user does guess the number correctly they will recive a message
saying well done you have  guessed the number correctly. The user will then be able to play a total of 3 round of the game where they can enter a number to check  
if the number is larger or less then what i am think of at the end of the rounds it will add up your score and display it. To start the game you press the run function.
