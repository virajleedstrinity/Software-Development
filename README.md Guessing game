#Guessing Game
How the my guessing game works is that the user will input a number between 1-100 and it will then check the number the user has input and the tell the user if the number they have entered is too high or too low. The user will then be able to guess 8 more times before they get told the actual number. If the user does guess the number correctly they will receive a message saying well done you have guessed the number correctly. The user will then be able to play a total of 3 round of the game where they can enter a number to check if the number is larger or less then what i am think of at the end of the rounds it will add up your score and display it. To start the game you press the run function. The user are not allowed to enter a number that is bigger than a 100 or lessen 0. If they do there will be a error message.
