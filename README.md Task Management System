#Task Managment System
How the Task management system run is that it creates two lists Task_During_Day and Task_During_Month, to store task for each day of the week and for each month of the year. There are three functions defined to deal with Adding ,Seeing and Removing tasks. The functions will get the user to select whether they want to add a task to a day or a month. It will then asks for specific day or month and the task they want to add and it will add the task to the correct list. The seeing function will ask the user if they want to see the task for the day or month. It will than ask the user to specify which day or month and print whatever task is stored for day or month. The Removing function will get the user to specify if they want to remove a task for the day or a month. It will then ask the user to specify which day or which month and then it will remove the task from the correrct list. The main part of the program runs in a while True loop it displays the menu of all the diffrent options the user can select. Depending on what the user selects it will call the appropriate function or it will exit the program.
