#Sudoku
How the sudoku code works is that it displays the sudoku grid ready for the user's answers. when the user enters the number and the row and colum number where the number needs to go the program will check the number against the same postion in the answer grid. Both question and answer grids are defined as a 2D list of (9x9 matrices) this is representing a sudoku puzzle with the solution to it.
The program makes sure the users can only input a number between 1 and 9.

The while loop will keep on running until The user completes puzzle or when it comes across a break where it will stop the while loop from carrying on. The sudoku code will get the user to enter a number (n)a row (r)and a column (c)number.The row and column number are adjusted by 1 to match the zero in the grid. The try-except function will dectect any input errors (eg. no integer was entered a). The code will then check the number that has been enterd to make sure it matches the correct number in the solution grid. It will also check if the current postion in the grid is zero. If both conditions are met it will then place the number in the grid if not it will print an error. The program will then check if the grid matches the solution then will print game is complete or will break and tell the user to continue. If The user enter a invalid input it will bring up a value error (eg. no interger has been entered) the program will handel the error. If the number enterd was lessen zero, zero or greater then nine it will then print an error message and continue the loop.
