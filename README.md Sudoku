#Sudoku
How my sudoku code work it that it display the sudoku gird and answer. Both girds are defined as a 2D list of (9x9 matrices) this is representing a sudoku puzzle with the solution to it. The while loop will keep on running until The user completes puzzle or when it comes across a break where it will stop the while loop from carrying on. The sudoku code will get the user to enter a number (n)a row (r)and a column (c)number.The row and column number are adjusted by taking 1 to match the zero which located in the idex of the  grid. The try-except function will dectect any input errors (eg. no integer was entered a). The code will then check the number that has been enterd to makesure it matches the correct number in the solution grid. It will also check in the current postion in the grid is empty. If both conditions are met it will then place the number in the grid if not it will print an error. The program will then check if the gird maches the soloution gird an then will print game is complete or will break and tell the user to contnue. If The user enter a invalid input it will bring up a value error (eg. no interger has been enterd) the program will handel the error.If the number enterd was 0 or greater then 9 it will then print an error message and continue the loop.
