# Software-Development
My task was to complete 3 diffrent labs by the 15th of novemebr 2024. The labs i have completed are 1,2,5,6.
# code realiablity and maintanibility
readability: readability in codes means how easily can a human reader can understand and comprehend the code. High readability in a codebase is crucial for many reasons:
Easier maintenance: code that is easy to read and understand can be maintained more efficiently. developer can quickly identify and fix bugs add new features and refactor the code without a steep learning curve.
collaboration: readable code enhances collaboration among team members. when multiple developers work on the same project clear and concise code will ensure everyone can understand each other’s contributions leading to smoother teamwork. 
onboarding: new developer joining a project can get up to speed faster if the code is readable. they will be able to understand the logic and the structure of the code without extensive explanations, reducing the time required for onboarding.
Reduced errors: clear code reduces the likelihood of introducing errors. when developers can easily understand what the code is supposed to do they are less likely to misinterpret its purpose and introduce bugs.
Uses comments wisely: comments should explain why something is done not what is being done as the code itself should be self-explanatory avoiding cluttering the code with obvious comments and focus on providing insight where the code purpose many not be immediately clear. 
Avoid deep nesting: deep nesting code is harder to read and to understand. Refactoring the code to minimize nesting by using early returns break statements or by splitting the code into smaller functions. 
code maintainability: maintainability goes back to the ease in which the code can be modified ,enhanced ,corrected. maintainable code is important for the long term success of the software as this allows it for quick adaptations and changing requirements and the ease of integration of new key features. the key parts for maintaining maintainable code is:
modular design: By breaking down the code into smaller more reusable and self-contained modules or functions it would make it easier to understand and test it would also be easy to modify. 
code readability writing clean readable code with meaningful variable names and having a consistent formatting in place would help. by adding comment to your code it would help to understand what that function does. in all my labs i have include comments so that users can understand what each function does it also helps user who have never seen a programming language.  
refactoring: By refactoring code on a regular basis will help to improve the structure without changing external behaviour this will help to eliminate technical debt and to main the codebase health. refactoring improves code efficiency and readability and ease of maintenance. 
dependency management: The correct control of dependency guarantees that the software can be upgraded or modified without triggering conflicts or breaking changes. use dependency management tools and keep dependencies up to date to ensure maintainability.
continuous integration and deployment’s CI/CD pipelines automate building testing and deployment procedures this is a method to help identify issues early. it ensures that updates are adequately tested and decreases the chance of introducing defects into the production environment.
