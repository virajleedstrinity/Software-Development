My task was to complete 3 diffrent labs by the 15th of novemebr 2024. The labs i have completed are 1,2,5,6.
# Code Readablity 
Readability of code is about how easily a human reader is able to understand and follow the logic of the code from start to finish. The readability of code is important for many reasons, as follows:

· Code that is easy to read and understand can be maintained more easily, because developers can quickly find bugs and fix it.

· Readable code allows team of developers to work together. When multiple developers work on the same project it is ideal to have clear and concise code as this will make sure that everyone can understand each other’s code and lead to a much better teamwork.

· Code readability will help new developers joining the project as it will help them get up to speed much faster. New developers will be able to understand the logic and the structure of the code without too much explanation.

· Clear code will help reduce the possibility of having errors in the code, as developers can easily understand the code logic and they are less likely to make a mistakes and possibility of introducing bugs.

Readability of code can be enhanced by:

· The use of indentations in the code, as it makes the code more structured and easier to read and understand.

· Use of proper naming conventions in the code improves the readability of the code, making it is easier to understand and follow, especially when the code is long and complex. For example, when defining variables, use meaningful and logical names and are used in a consistent format throughout the code.

· Adding useful comments throughout the code. The comments should explain the code logic and ideally focus on providing an insight and elaborate on where the code might not have a clear meaning. However avoid adding too many obvious comments, which adds little value to the reader and clutters up the code unncessarity. 
# Code Mintainability
Maintainability of the code is about how easily code can be modified, improved or corrected by a developer. Maintainability of code is an important part of developing good quality, good performing, sustainable and long lasting software. The maintainability of code is important for the following reasons:

· It will reduce the development time in a project, as clear and well organized code will reduces the time spent understanding and debugging. This allows developer to focus on building new features and improving the software. This will lead to faster development cycle.

· Easier to debug and test code. Code that is easy to read and maintain can make debugging and testing simple as developers can quickly detect issues and understand the impact this will lead to more efficient problem solving.

· Maintainable code is important then working in a team of developers as it makes it easier for others to work on the code, even if they did not develop it.

To make the code maintainable, it should be written in a consistent and logical format, be modular with elements that can be reused throughout the code, where possible.
